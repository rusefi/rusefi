* playing with some GDI software, but now waiting for repaired MC33816 to come from Seattle
* Matt and DronoGus are working on different parts of getting stepper control using two universal H-bridged, that would give us stepper idle control on microRusEfi.
* A _lot_ of hardware to play with - v12 on Manhattan, v12 on Proteus, setting up microRusEfi fabrication.

* Ion Sense https://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=963 is now somewhere on top of the list!
* [DONE] build server is reliable again
* [DONE] Electronic throttle body is now road-tested including idle control
* CJ125 - probably falling off the wagon since no time :(

* new annoying issue: integration testing on new build server is unreliable - disconnects https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/issues/816
* https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/issues/796 should be addressed
* Electronic throttle body - two and three wire control seems good enough, next step ETB-based idle control see https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/issues/783 
* Ion Sense https://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=963
* HIP9011 - still need to improve unit tests and give this functionality another test now that we can reproduce detonation
* CJ125 - still need to improve unit tests and give this functionality another test
