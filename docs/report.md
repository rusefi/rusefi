## 2026-07-14 - Investigation: "Malformed Packet: packet length" in USB.pcapng

What was done:
- Analyzed USB.pcapng (USBPcap capture of the rusEFI ECU USB link, device address 7)
  using tshark to explain the "malformed packet" warnings.

Findings:
- Protocol hierarchy: 84926 frames, mostly USB mass storage (usbms/scsi) plus 2 CDC
  (usbcom) control frames. 23 SCSI frames + 1 URB frame flagged _ws.malformed.
- The 23 usbms malformed frames are ALL the same case: the device reply to
  SCSI Mode Sense(6) (opcode 0x1a). Wireshark message: "SCSI: length of contained
  item exceeds length of containing item".
- Root cause is a Wireshark dissector strictness issue, NOT bad wire data. The 16-byte
  reply is self-consistent:
      0f 00 00 00  08 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Mode Data Length=15 (=total-1), Caching mode page (0x08) with PageLength=0x0a=10.
  SBC-2 mandates the Caching page be 0x12=18 long (20-byte page); rusEFI emits a valid
  but non-standard SHORT caching page. Wireshark decodes the full 20-byte layout, reads
  past the 16-byte buffer, and raises the exception. Windows accepts it -> device works.
- Response is hardcoded in ChibiOS-Contrib USB-MSD SCSI target (os/hal/src/hal_usb_msd.c,
  submodule not checked out locally), driven by
  firmware/hw_layer/mass_storage/mass_storage_device.cpp.
- Frames 27759-27772 "USBPcap did not recognize URB Function code" are a USBPcap capture-
  driver limitation, unrelated to rusEFI traffic.

Decisions:
- Classified as cosmetic; no code change made. Not a functional defect.

Validation:
- tshark -z io,phs, per-frame -V dissection, and raw -x hex confirmed the byte layout
  and that all 23 malformed frames share the Mode Sense(6) cause.

Open follow-ups:
- Optional cleanup if the warning ever matters: set the Caching mode page length to 0x12
  and pad the page to the full 20 bytes, or drop the caching page from the Mode Sense
  reply. Lives upstream in ChibiOS-Contrib hal_usb_msd.c.

## 2026-07-14 - SD ECU<->PC switch soak sandbox + USB CDC link-drop investigation

What was done:
- Created a headless soak sandbox SdEcuPcCycleSandbox in the :ui test subproject
  (java_console/ui/src/test/java/com/rusefi/SdEcuPcCycleSandbox.java), modeled on the
  purple-gateway SdPcToEcuSwitchSandbox. It cycles the SD card ECU/logging <-> PC/MSD 10
  times, 20s dwell per mode, confirming each switch via the sd_present / sd_logging_internal
  / sd_msd output channels, and reports a pass/fail tally. Added Gradle task :ui:runSdCycle.
- Initialized two uninitialized git submodules required by the Java build:
  java_console/peak-can-basic (missing peak.can.basic.* -> :ecu_io compile fail) and
  java_console/luaformatter (missing neoe.formatter.lua -> :ui compile fail).

Result of the run (COM149, purple-gateway fw, USB-powered only / no +12V):
- Cycle 1 fully succeeded BOTH directions. PC/MSD->ECU no longer hits FR_DISK_ERR: firmware
  logged "SD: switched from PC/MSD to ECU/logging" and opened log file re_10.mlg; status bits
  confirmed sd_logging_internal=1.
- ~1.5s after the ECU switch the host CDC serial link dropped:
  "output channels: executeCommand failed: java.io.IOException: write failed: wrote 0 but
  expected 11", COM149 closed. Never recovered, so cycle 2's first command got no response and
  the soak aborted at 1/20. Sandbox behaved correctly - it detected and reported the drop.

Root cause (investigated, code-evidenced):
- CDC console and USB mass storage are interfaces on ONE composite USB device (USBD1). The
  config descriptor is fixed at 3 interfaces - MSD IF0 + CDC-control IF1 + CDC-data IF2, 98
  bytes (usbcfg.cpp DESCRIPTOR_SIZE/NUM_INTERFACES). MSD is always present in the enumerated
  descriptor whenever HAL_USE_USB_MSD is built in.
- The SD mode switch does NOT re-enumerate or reconfigure USB. attachMsdSdCard /
  deattachMsdSdCard (mass_storage_init.cpp) merely hot-swap LUN1's backing block device
  between the real SD card and the null device ND1 on the already-running MSD controller.
- Causal chain: PC/MSD->ECU calls deattachMsdSdCard() which swaps LUN1 (SD card -> ND1) while
  Windows still has that mass-storage volume mounted -> the medium vanishes under the mounted
  volume -> the Windows usbstor stack resets/re-enumerates the whole composite device to
  recover -> firmware gets USB_EVENT_RESET/SUSPEND, whose handler calls sduSuspendHookI(&SDU1)
  (usbcfg.cpp:446), tearing down the CDC channel -> host CDC write returns 0, COM149 drops.
- It is host-side (write wrote 0 = port handle invalidated), not a firmware stall: the switch
  completed cleanly, logging started, and the device kept emitting messages up to the drop.

Remediation directions (not implemented - investigation only):
- Don't swap the MSD LUN to a dead null device under a mounted volume. Instead present a stable
  medium or return SCSI "not ready / medium not present" (unit attention) so Windows performs an
  orderly media-eject rather than treating it as a device fault and resetting the port.
- Or signal proper SCSI medium-removal / unit-attention before switching so the host dismounts
  cleanly.
- Host-side, for a true 10x soak: reconnect LinkManager after each switch (treat the CDC drop
  as expected re-enumeration). The current sandbox intentionally reports it instead.
- The existing USB.pcapng capture can confirm the host-issued bus reset around a mode switch.

Validation:
- ./gradlew :ui:compileTestJava BUILD SUCCESSFUL after submodule init.
- ./gradlew :ui:runSdCycle exercised against real hardware; full log captured.

Open follow-ups:
- Decide remediation approach (firmware SCSI media-eject vs host-side reconnect).
- Consider gating: the soak cannot complete 10 cycles over one connection until the CDC drop is
  addressed.

## 2026-07-14 - SD indicator/output-channel name reuse between SdEcuPcCycleSandbox and .ini

What was done:
- Removed the duplicated magic strings sd_present / sd_logging_internal / sd_msd that existed
  independently in output_channels.txt (bit field names), tunerstudio.template.ini (6 indicator
  expressions) and SdEcuPcCycleSandbox.java (SensorCentral lookups). They now flow from a single
  source of truth via the existing code generation.

Change inventory:
| File                                                        | Change                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| firmware/integration/rusefi_config_shared.txt               | new OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_PRESENT / _SD_LOGGING_INTERNAL / _SD_MSD quoted defines |
| firmware/console/binary/output_channels.txt                 | the 3 SD bit fields renamed to @#OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_...#@ references |
| firmware/tunerstudio/tunerstudio.template.ini               | 6 indicator lines reference @#OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_...#@           |
| java_tools/.../ReaderStateImpl.java (config_definition_base)| handleBitLine now applies variable substitution to the bit name (comment stays templated, matching plain-field parsing) |
| java_tools/.../ConfigFieldParserTest.java                   | new testBitNameViaVariableReference                             |
| java_console/.../SdEcuPcCycleSandbox.java                   | uses VariableRegistryValues.OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_* constants       |
| java_tools/version/.../UiVersion.java                       | CONSOLE_VERSION -> 20260714                                     |

Key decisions and why:
- Constants live in rusefi_config_shared.txt because it is prepended by BOTH pipelines that need
  them: gen_config_common.sh (template .ini + VariableRegistryValues.java) and the LiveData.yaml
  output_channels entry (LiveDataProcessor parsing output_channels.txt).
- Used the existing @#NAME#@ quote-stripping substitution (same as TS_HELLO_COMMAND usages) so the
  quoted define yields a bare identifier in struct field names and { } indicator expressions while
  generating a proper Java String constant.
- handleBitLine substitution was narrowed to the name part only: applying it to the whole line
  expanded @@...@@ comment templates at parse time, which changed engine_state_generated.h
  (clutchDownState comment). The narrowed version keeps every generated artifact byte-identical.
- Did not resurrect the deleted generated TsOutputs.java (removed in #6711); defines + existing
  VariableRegistryValues generation is the sanctioned mechanism.

Validation:
- ./gradlew :config_definition:test :config_definition_base:test green including the new test.
- gen_live_documentation.sh + gen_config_board.sh f407-discovery: all generated outputs
  (output_channels_generated.h, live_data_fragments.ini, data_logs.ini, board .ini indicator
  lines) byte-identical to committed state; only VariableRegistryValues.java gains the 3 new
  String constants. Board-generated .h/.ini signature/date churn reverted (CI regenerates).
- ./gradlew :ui:compileTestJava BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the sandbox on the generated constants.

Open follow-ups:
- Other magic output-channel names shared between java_console and .ini (e.g. sd_error,
  sd_formating, sd_active_wr/rd) could adopt the same pattern when java code starts using them.

## 2026-07-14 - N52 preset: bake in TPS/PPS calibration from reference tune

What: Ported TPS + PPS calibration out of the "super N52" TunerStudio tune (CurrentTune.msq)
into the `bmwN52()` engine preset in `firmware/config/engines/bmw.cpp`, so a fresh N52 selection
ships with the real throttle-body/pedal calibration instead of raw defaults.

| Field(s)                                                   | Source (msq, volts) | Stored as |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| tpsMin / tpsMax                                            | 4.545 / 0.58        | 10-bit ADC via convertVoltageTo10bitADC |
| tps1SecondaryMin / tps1SecondaryMax                       | 0.75 / 4.72         | 10-bit ADC via convertVoltageTo10bitADC |
| throttlePedalUpVoltage / throttlePedalWOTVoltage          | 0.625 / 2.230       | float volts (verbatim) |
| throttlePedalSecondaryUpVoltage / ...WOTVoltage           | 0.947 / 4.197       | float volts (verbatim) |

Key decisions:
- Used shared helpers setTPS1Calibration()/setPPSCalibration() (defaults.h), matching subaru.cpp.
- TPS stored as 10-bit ADC counts (not volts): wrapped msq volts in convertVoltageTo10bitADC
  (= volts*200). PPS stored as float volts, copied through directly. This units split is the main
  porting hazard and is now documented.
- Skipped tps2* fields: msq had them at defaults (0/5, 5/0); N52 runs a single dual-sensor throttle.
- Added #include "defaults.h"; convertVoltageTo10bitADC comes transitively via pch.h.

Docs: new docs/AI/engine_presets.md documents the canned-tune/preset process end to end
(enum -> engine_type_impl.cpp dispatch -> config/engines setup fn), the TPS-vs-PPS units gotcha,
and a step-by-step msq->preset porting recipe.

Validation: static review only - mirrors the established subaru.cpp calibration pattern; all
referenced helpers are declared in the included headers. No generated files touched (presets are
plain code, no gen_config step).

Open follow-ups:
- Confirm on hardware that a defaults-reset N52 reads plausible TPS

## 2026-07-15 - SD card logging: overview doc + code comments (f_expand logic)

What: Documented the SD card logging subsystem and annotated its three core source files.

| File | Change |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| docs/AI/sd_card_logging.md (new)                       | End-to-end overview: SD thread mode state machine (IDLE/ECU/PC/UNMOUNT/FORMAT, all transitions via IDLE), .mlg vs .teeth loggers, FileBufferedWriter path, f_expand pre-allocation, file naming, status channels, console commands |
| firmware/hw_layer/mmc_card.cpp                         | Expanded LOGGER_MAX_FILE_SIZE, f_expand and f_truncate comments; doc pointer in file header |
| firmware/console/binary_mlg_log/binary_mlg_logging.cpp | File-header overview (MLG v2 layout, who owns file lifecycle); comments on writeFileHeader/writeSdBlock/writeSdLogLine/resetFileLogging |
| firmware/console/binary/tooth_logger.cpp               | Comment on freeBuffers/filledBuffers multi-buffering (BigBuffer, interrupt producers -> TS/SD consumers); ToothLoggerWriter() contract incl. 3s idle timeout -> new file |
| CLAUDE.md                                              | Added sd_card_logging.md to Deep Dive AI Guidance list |

Key facts captured (the f_expand logic in particular):
- sdLoggerCreateFile() pre-allocates each log file to 32Mb with f_expand(fd, size, opt=1)
  (allocate-now, contiguous; FF_USE_EXPAND=1 in firmware/ext/FatFS/ffconf.h). All FAT
  updates happen up-front, so writes inside the pre-allocated area never touch FAT
  structures -> sudden power loss loses buffered data but not the filesystem.
- f_expand failure (fragmented card) is deliberately non-fatal: FatFS falls back to
  cluster-by-cluster growth, logging works without the corruption protection.
- sdLoggerCloseFile() f_truncate()s back to actual size; a power-lossed file stays 32Mb
  with trailing garbage.
- Both loggers share sdLoggerCreateFile() (so .teeth files are pre-allocated too) but
  only sdLoggerMlg() enforces the 32Mb rollover cap.

Validation: comment/doc-only changes, no code touched; facts verified against source
(mmc_card.cpp, file_writer.h, ffconf.h FF_USE_EXPAND=1, tooth_logger.cpp, sd_log_trigger.h).

Open follow-ups: none.

## 2026-07-15 - Lua scripting API: categorized hook inventory doc

What: Reviewed every custom Lua method registered around lua_hooks.cpp and documented
them in a new docs/AI/lua_scripting.md, grouped into 11 categories.

| File | Change |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| docs/AI/lua_scripting.md (new) | Full inventory of Lua hooks by category: input reads, virtual sensors, virtual switches, closed-loop trims, cut/disable controls, PWM/DAC outputs, CAN, config/calibration access, state queries, luaaa helper classes, framework/test hooks; plus registration-site map, indexing conventions, build-flag gating, and an "adding a new hook" recipe |
| CLAUDE.md | Added lua_scripting.md to the Deep Dive AI Guidance list |

Key decisions / findings:
- Registration is spread over four files: lua_hooks.cpp (bulk + luaaa classes),
  lua_hooks_util.cpp (print/interpolate/find*/mcu_standby), lua.cpp (setTickRate,
  onTick dispatch), lua_can_rx.cpp (onCanRx dispatch, global_can_data workaround).
  lua_hooks_ext.cpp is an empty extension point; boardConfigureLuaHooks() is a weak
  board hook with no in-tree overrides.
- Documented the mixed indexing convention explicitly: 1-based (HUMAN_OFFSET) for
  TS-facing entities (CAN bus, curves, tables, TS buttons, gauges), 0-based for
  sensor indices, PWM channels, aux digital inputs, vin().
- Documented flash-saving exclusions (#if !defined(STM32F4) group) and the
  DISABLE_LUA_* / WITH_LUA_* opt-out macros.
- setTickRate code clamps 1..2000 Hz while its comment says 1..200 - doc records
  the code behavior (comment discrepancy left in source, not a functional issue).

Validation: doc-only change; every listed hook, guard macro and constant
(LUA_PWM_COUNT=8, LUA_GAUGE_COUNT=8, LUA_DIGITAL_INPUT_COUNT=8, LUA_BUTTON_COUNT=10,
CMD_BURNCONFIG="burnconfig") verified against source via grep/read of the four
registration files, lua_pid.h and rusefi_config.txt.

Open follow-ups:
- lua.cpp setTickRate comment ("Limit to 1..200 hz") disagrees with clampF(1, x, 2000).
- lua_hooks.cpp has a commented-out hasCriticalReportFile hook referencing issue #7291.
