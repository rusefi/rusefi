## 2026-07-14 - Investigation: "Malformed Packet: packet length" in USB.pcapng

What was done:
- Analyzed USB.pcapng (USBPcap capture of the rusEFI ECU USB link, device address 7)
  using tshark to explain the "malformed packet" warnings.

Findings:
- Protocol hierarchy: 84926 frames, mostly USB mass storage (usbms/scsi) plus 2 CDC
  (usbcom) control frames. 23 SCSI frames + 1 URB frame flagged _ws.malformed.
- The 23 usbms malformed frames are ALL the same case: the device reply to
  SCSI Mode Sense(6) (opcode 0x1a). Wireshark message: "SCSI: length of contained
  item exceeds length of containing item".
- Root cause is a Wireshark dissector strictness issue, NOT bad wire data. The 16-byte
  reply is self-consistent:
      0f 00 00 00  08 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Mode Data Length=15 (=total-1), Caching mode page (0x08) with PageLength=0x0a=10.
  SBC-2 mandates the Caching page be 0x12=18 long (20-byte page); rusEFI emits a valid
  but non-standard SHORT caching page. Wireshark decodes the full 20-byte layout, reads
  past the 16-byte buffer, and raises the exception. Windows accepts it -> device works.
- Response is hardcoded in ChibiOS-Contrib USB-MSD SCSI target (os/hal/src/hal_usb_msd.c,
  submodule not checked out locally), driven by
  firmware/hw_layer/mass_storage/mass_storage_device.cpp.
- Frames 27759-27772 "USBPcap did not recognize URB Function code" are a USBPcap capture-
  driver limitation, unrelated to rusEFI traffic.

Decisions:
- Classified as cosmetic; no code change made. Not a functional defect.

Validation:
- tshark -z io,phs, per-frame -V dissection, and raw -x hex confirmed the byte layout
  and that all 23 malformed frames share the Mode Sense(6) cause.

Open follow-ups:
- Optional cleanup if the warning ever matters: set the Caching mode page length to 0x12
  and pad the page to the full 20 bytes, or drop the caching page from the Mode Sense
  reply. Lives upstream in ChibiOS-Contrib hal_usb_msd.c.
