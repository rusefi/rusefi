# R0.3

Pre-assembly notes:

-- 0.22uF needs at least 100V, but I only found a 50V option, so that one is not populated by china. This is QTY 4. 
(C16 C17 C25 C27)

-- 0R010 may not need to be 0R010, there are several 0R015. However this is not populated at this time. Further research might allow it to be populated. It's only QTY 1.
