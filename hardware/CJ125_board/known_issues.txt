 1) RESOLVED IN R0.2 SOIC24 wrong size
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Q1 MOSFET is not connected properly. 
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.3 DIAHD silkscreen on pad #6 should be DIAHG
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.3 add a note describing UR (R8) and UA (R15) low pass filter / slew rate limiter
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.3 Correct C9 should match C2 for 1kHz low pass filter. 
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.3 R12 is not routed right
 7)                  voltage divider on UR and UA channels
