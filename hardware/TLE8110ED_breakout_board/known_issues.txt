 1)                  set solder mask to 0.003 inches, per OSHPark suggestion.
 2)                  make footprint pads longer so that we have some metal not covered by the chip 
 3)                  since RST is not needed, connect with Pull-up resistor to VCC
 4)                  since EN is not needed, connect with Pull-up resistor to VCC
 5)                  it is highly recommended to connect the exposed pad to GND pins on the PCB.
