 1) RESOLVED IN R0.2 upper mounting hole does not align - see http://rusefi.com/images/Frankenso/frankenso_0_1_back.jpg
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add a jumper to isolate C1002 & C1003 while powered via USB? see http://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=569&start=50#p9859
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.2 usability issue: GND test pad is under discovery
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add larger +5 test pad?
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add +12 test point?
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Thermocouple needs a via to allow a zip tie to go fully around the connector.
 7) RESOLVED IN R0.2 op-amp reference & part # silkscreen is upside down in relation to the labeling of the actual chips
 8) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Make HIP9011 components into 0805 for common parts
 9) RESOLVED IN R0.2 VDD on STM discovery should be 3V not 5V.  
10) RESOLVED IN R0.2 LCD mounting holes are too small for the Chinese M3 stand-offs
11) RESOLVED IN R0.2 SD card PB4 should be SO not SI PB5 should be SI not SO. 
12) RESOLVED IN R0.2 USB D- and D+ were on wrong pins, D+ now on USB pin 3, TTL RX and TX were also on the wrong pins 
13) RESOLVED IN R0.2 JP212 is to close to the LCD mounting slot.
14)                  separate VP lines of our three hi-side mosfers
15) RESOLVED IN R0.2 look into flipping the VR + and - pins
16) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add vias for GND, 12V and 5V for test purposes
17) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add option to GND one side of VR in ECU
18) RESOLVED IN R0.2 HC-OX needs 3.3V not 5V. 
19)                  BOM issue: D1001 should be BZT52C7V5-FDICT-ND?
20)                  BOM issue: C1001 sch says 470uF but part number is 100uF?
21)                  SKQUCAA010 is End of Life. I've placed and order to get these in October, but we need a better solution
22) RESOLVED IN R0.2 JP212 should be replaced with JP209 which would be breaking the OUT9 line. That's part of hall-via-op-amp circuirty.  
23)                  chip select and such for SPI on thermo-couple chips. 
24)                  Change joy stick to ALPS SKRHAAE010 
25) RESOLVED IN R0.2 add a prototype area for future circuits to be tossed in.
26)                  add a couple more low-side chips
27) RESOLVED IN R0.2 surge suppression diode option for some low-side
28) RESOLVED IN R0.2 better silkscreen for P602 & P604 - explicit "5v" "12v" "GND"
29) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Add LED indicators to injector channels. 
30) RESOLVED IN R0.3 3D for C1001 bulk cap has black mark on wrong side
31) RESOLVED IN R0.3 R0.3 We've moved the upper mounting hole too far - we need to move it half way back http://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=735#p12500
32) RESOLVED IN R0.3 R0.3 C1001 should be 1mm lower to improve clearance with the case
32)                  R0.3 Q411 should be 1.5mm lower to improve clearance with the case
33)                  R0.3 Q412 should be moved 3mm to the left, this would probably affect W63 which would affect the whole corner. Maybe move Q412 to the back of the board?
34) RESOLVED IN R0.3 R0.3 rename the recently added low-side diodes and LEDs/resistors into 400 range
35)                  test pads explicit silkscreen
36)                  test pads on the back of the board
37)                  U601/2/3: hard to see pad #1 label on the silkscreen
38)                  cap values format inconsistency: C165 is ".1u", C24 C355 C471 C701 are ".1uF" and C104 C211 C291 etc are "0.1uF"
39)                  rename JP212 to JP09 since it's sitting on input channel #9
40)                  JP211 silkscreen not visible on rev 0.2 (was visible on rev 0.1 before the JP211 move)
41)                  (pedantism) eliminate the 4 unused middle pins on the LCD screen connector
42)                  Wxx silkscreen on the back where it's possible - this would help while troubleshooting analog inputs
43)                  D7 & R11 - 5v status LED close to stm32 is duplicating LED on the power supply
44)                  vertical USB socket - the connector does not go in. the 5 signal through-holes are too small?
45)                  arm chip +5v not connected to main PCB +5?
 




For honda add-on / rewiring board
-- Add 2A high side solinoid drive for VTec sol
-- Add 3rd VR chip for 3rd signal
-- Add selectable high side drive with +5V or +12V options
-- re-wire to allow freindly pinout
