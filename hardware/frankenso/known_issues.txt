46) RESOLVED IN R0.3  Short out D10.
47) RESOLVED IN R0.4  add vias around ST processor. Orginal board design was a 2 layer, not it's 4 layer. It's better design practice to have GND via's closer to the GND pins.
48) RESOLVED IN R0.3  Per 32) and 33) change W64,63 change to single hole, which allows U chips to move away from enclosre metal wall
49)                   Make hidden text for component values align such that a picture can be caputured that displays the component values.

58) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Change C166 and C167 to 27pF instead of 20/18pF, to match XTAL specified 20CL. (30*30)/(30+30)+5= 20pF with 5pF stray capacitance.

67)                   JP04 & JP05 are defined on the main schematics sheet. It would be better to define then on Page 8 with the rest of cam/crank stuff
68) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Updated silk screen notes, draws .12 amps normal, with a typical inrush of .3A. 
69) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Look into LCD dimming R99, perhaps replace with a POT. Perhaps connect to a GPIO
70) RESOLVED IN R0.5 Clamp input voltage, as of R0.4 a surge will likely blow an upstream fuse. FIXED, ADDED Q1003 AND FRIENDS

80) RESOLVED IN R0.4  on schematics, rename INJ_xx to LOW_xx? "inj" is a bit confusing, it implies that PE6 is injector #1 while it is usually not the case
81) RESOLVED IN R0.4  set analog input values to match https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTvS7I-128Hft9uXHG1JrBxetVjGJDSBkySgVDQ6MGk/edit#gid=0
