 - Changed scheduling timer driver to improve scheduling accuracy #1983

### Fixed
 - microRusEFI GP3 & GP4 fixed

## December 2020 National Mutt Day

### Fixed
 -  minor bugfix - engine sniffer missing pin names #1995

## November 2020 Release - "Black Friday"

### Breaking Changes
 -   "AFR target" table is now "Lambda target" table.  It should convert itself correctly, but a backup of that table is recommended when updating firmware/ini.
 -   "Base cranking fuel" is now in milligrams, using the full injector model at all times now.  60mg per liter per cylinder is a good starting point

### Added
 -   High & low pressure fuel sensor channels
 -   Electronic throttle-style wastegate control found on some VW turbos (and VGTs)
 -   Improved TLE8888 driver on microRusEFI
 -   Improved setting ECU presets/defaults from TunerStudio

### Fixed
 -   Improved TunerStudio protocol reliability - should see fewer CRC errors now #1943

## October 2020 Release - "Sausage Pizza Day"

### Added
 -   `iat` as FSIO variable to read intake air temperature
 -   [ALPHA] Software based knock detection on Proteus v0.4+.  Possible on microRusEFI and Frankenso too with hardware modification.
 -   [ALPHA] Early framing work for automatic transmission control!

### Fixed
 -   Fixed fuel pump logic
 -   Improve trigger input/decode and PWM performance
 -   Fixes to SD card logging
