/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * @section sec_into
 *
 * rusEfi is implemented based on the idea that with modern 100+ MHz microprocessors the relatively
 * undemanding task of internal combustion engine control could be implemented in a high-level, processor-independent
 * (to some extent) manner. Thus the key concepts of rusEfi: dependency on high-level hardware abstraction layer, software-based PWM etc.
 *
 * @section sec_main Brief overview
 *
 * rusEfi runs on crankshaft or camshaft ('trigger') position sensor events.
 * Once per crankshaft revolution we evaluate the amount of needed fuel and
 * the spark timing. Once we have decided on the parameters for this revolution
 * we schedule all the actions to be triggered by the closest trigger event.
 *
 * We also have some utility threads like idle control thread and communication threads.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_trigger Trigger Decoding
 *
 * Our primary trigger decoder is based on the idea of synchronizing the primary shaft signal and simply counting events on
 * the secondary signal. A typical scenario would be when camshaft positions sensor is the primary signal and crankshaft is secondary,
 * but sometimes there would be two signals generated by two camshaft sensors.
 * Another scenario is when we only have crankshaft position sensor, this would make it the primary signal and there would be no secondary signal.
 *
 * There is no software filtering so the signals are expected to be valid. TODO: in reality we are still catching engine stop noise as unrealisticly high RPM.
 *
 * The decoder is configured to act either on the primary signal rise or on the primary signal fall. It then compares the duration
 * of time from the previous signal to the duration of time from the signal before previous, and if the ratio falls into the configurable
 * range between 'syncRatioFrom' and 'syncRatioTo' this is assumed to be the synchronizing event.
 *
 * For instance, for a 36/1 skipped tooth wheel the ratio range for synchronization is from 1.5 to 3
 *
 * Some triggers do not require synchronization, this case we just count signals.
 * A single tooth primary signal would be a typical example when synchronization is not needed.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_scheduler Event Scheduler
 *
 * It is a general agreement to measure all angles in crankshaft angles. In a four stroke
 * engine, a full cycle consists of two revolutions of the crankshaft, so all the angles are
 * running between 0 and 720 degrees.
 *
 * Ignition timing is a great example of a process which highlights the need of a hybrid
 * approach to event scheduling.
 * The most important part of controlling ignition
 * is firing up the spark at the right moment - so, for this job we need 'angle-based' timing,
 * for example we would need to fire up the spark at 700 degrees. Before we can fire up the spark
 * at 700 degrees, we need to charge the ignition coil, for example this dwell time is 4ms - that
 * means we need to turn on the coil at '4 ms before 700 degrees'. Let's  assume that the engine is
 * current at 600 RPM - that means 360 degrees would take 100ms so 4ms is 14.4 degrees at current RPM which
 * means we need to start charting the coil at 685.6 degrees.
 *
 * The position sensors at our disposal are not providing us the current position at any moment of time -
 * all we've got is a set of events which are happening at the knows positions. For instance, let's assume that
 * our sensor sends as an event at 0 degrees, at 90 degrees, at 600 degrees and and 690 degrees.
 *
 * So, for this particular sensor the most precise scheduling would be possible if we schedule coil charting
 * as '85.6 degrees after the 600 degrees position sensor event', and spark firing as
 * '10 degrees after the 690 position sensor event'. Considering current RPM, we calculate that '10 degress after' is
 * 2.777ms, so we schedule spark firing at '2.777ms after the 690 position sensor event', thus combining trigger events
 * with time-based offset.
 *
 * @section config Persistent Configuration
 * engine_configuration_s structure is kept in the internal flash memory, it has all the settings. Currently rusefi.ini has a direct mapping of this structure.
 *
 * Please note that due to TunerStudio protocol it's important to have the total structure size in synch between the firmware and TS .ini file -
 * just to make sure that this is not forgotten the size of the structure is hard-coded as PAGE_0_SIZE constant. There is always some 'unused' fields added in advance so that
 * one can add some fields without the pain of increasing the total config page size.
