// this is related to wasted spark idea where engines fire each spark twice per 4 stroke 720 degree cycle of operations
// first spark is happens on intake stroke and actually ignites fuel mixture, that's the useful one
// the other spark 360 degrees later happens during exhaust stroke meaning there is nothing to ignite, that spark is known as "wasted" spark
// historically this was about sharing ignition coils between opposite cylinders and having two high voltage wire coming from one physical coil
// more recently same idea happens with two individual physical coils (meaning two outputs) since wasted spark of operation is useful
// while exact engine phase is either not known YET (cranking) or just not known (broken cam sensor)
// so, while in wasted spark we manage half of cylinder count _events_ potentially with each event having two outputs
//
// an interesting corner case is when we transition from wasted spark mode into individual/sequential mode
