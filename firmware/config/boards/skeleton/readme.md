# Skeleton Board

This directory contains an example of the files needed to configure the
firmware for a specific RusEFI board.

The files here
 - select specific features to be included into the firmware
 - firmware to configure and support unique features of the board
 - set communication channels (USB, serial, CAN) and parameters e.g. speed 
 - set the default GPIO pin configuration for use at startup

Note that many settings may be immediately reconfigured by the engine
configuration.
